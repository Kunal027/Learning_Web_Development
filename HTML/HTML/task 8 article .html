        <article><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong></article>
        <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting<br /> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever<br /> since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled <br /> it to make
            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries.

            <p>But also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br /> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem<br /> Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                like Aldus PageMaker<br /> including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
